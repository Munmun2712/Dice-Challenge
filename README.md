# Dice-Challenge
The Dice Challenge is a simple yet engaging project designed to practice and enhance your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. In this challenge, you'll create a dynamic web page that simulates the rolling of two dice. The goal is to generate random values for two players, display the dice images and declare the winner based on the dice values.
